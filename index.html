      <h1>Narendra Damodardas Modi</h1>
      <p>
        Narendra Damodardas Modi is an Indian politician who has served as the 14th prime minister of India since May 2014. 
        Modi was the Chief Minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Varanasi. 
        He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary volunteer organisation. 
        He is the longest-serving prime minister from outside the Indian National Congress.

        Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. 
        His account of helping his father sell tea at the Vadnagar railway station has not been reliably corroborated. 
        At age 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades later when legally required to do so. 
        Modi became a full-time worker for the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.

                     According to Modi, as a child, he had to work in his father's tea shop on the platform of Vadnagar railway station,
                     his father had brought up six of his children by selling tea and people were making a big mistake by calling the Prime Minister a "chai wala".

            In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency in India that lasted until 1977. During this period, known as "the Emergency", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.
            Modi was appointed general secretary of the "Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti", an RSS committee co-ordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.
            Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest, once dressing as a monk and once as a Sikh.

            Modi rose within the party and was named a member of its National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise Advani's Ram Rath Yatra in 1990 and Murli Manohar Joshi's 1991-1992 Ekta Yatra (Journey for Unity).
            The following year, Shankersinh Vaghela, a prominent BJP leader from Gujarat, defected to the Indian National Congress (Congress) after losing his parliamentary seat in the Lok Sabha election.
            Modi, who was on the selection committee for the 1998 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election, favoured supporters of BJP leader Keshubhai Patel over those supporting Vaghela to end factional division in the party. 
           His strategy was credited as central to the BJP winning an overall majority in the 1998 election,and Modi was promoted to BJP general secretary (organisation) in May of that year.
